# ProductParty
Web Application to tally party guests guesses of the price and type of products being consumed at the party.

Guests start at /start.php where they enter their name. They then end up at EnterRating.php where they enter ratings on different products. They ratings include the guest's estimate of the actual price and the product type (for wine this would be the type of wine: cabernet, pinot grigio, etc). These entries are compared to actual prices and types and a total accuracy is kept and ranked compared to other guests at the party.

Leaderboard.php displays the current ranking of each guest in real time.

Reveal.php displays each product and it's stats.
